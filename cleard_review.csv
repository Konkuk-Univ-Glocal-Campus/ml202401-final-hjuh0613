The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design.

"I bought two of these kits to make ten gallons. After 3 weeks in the 2- 5 gallon primary's I kegged 5 gallons. The instructions for the vodka, spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it. I mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented. It turned into a snot ball. I sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while I kegged I added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball. It worked for the most part. The first 3 beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up. The potion made the beer taste a bit like cider. It's got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon. I'm not a big fan of these prominent flavors so I bottled the second 5 gallons without the potion.Overall the kits good. The abv came out at about 6.9 after adding an extra pound of dextrose.I expect he bottles to be a bit more to my liking.",3.0,positive,bought two kit make ten gallon week gallon primary kegged gallon instruction vodka spice vanilla bean slurry vague make potion store mixed mine brew day sat fridge beer fermented turned snot ball sanitized mason jar took half ten gallon worth potion mixture kegged added beer jar shook vigorously break snot ball worked part first beer came bit chunky cleared potion made beer taste bit like cider got upfront pumkin spice kick hint cinnamon im big fan prominent flavor bottled second gallon without potionoverall kit good abv came adding extra pound dextrosei expect bottle bit liking

"This really is the best root beer I have ever tasted! I usually buy it in our grocery store (about 4.50 per four pack), but it's sold out a lot!

"Virgils Natural Micro Brewed Rootbeer Soda, 12 Ounce -- 24 per case, from Virgils Rootbeer.I have mixed feelings about Virgil's Rootbeer. To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Virgil's RootBeer is natural and definitely different, but as a root beer, I can only give it three and a half Amazon stars, rounded off to four stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.The Nutrition Facts, and Ingredients, as listed on the bottle:Nutrition Facts:Serving size: 12 oz.

Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink.

I like that taste, having done some experiments based on the Parsons book, and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters I've tried.But, I have to say, I still prefer my own walnut-based flavors. This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, it's good. If I didn't make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: I'm not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper.

They also have it in a lite version......sugar-free and I thought that would be great......not so. I drink suger-free pop, but this doesn't taste as good in the sugar-free version. So tomorrow I am going to exchange 2 of the bottles for the regular type. Hey, a few carbs here and there.....oh well! Love Walmart!

And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013.

The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible.

"I was so happy to have located Mr Mrs T Mai Tai Mix at Wallmart on-line. It is nearly impossible to find it in NJ (grocery or liquor stores).

Just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing Baccardi Rum garnish with Maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple (on a skewer).

"I recently have begun enjoying margaritas. I havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet. I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.",5.0,positive,recently begun enjoying margarita havent done lot searching different mix pretty sure one good bet like margarita rock mix seems really trick far flavor reason even picked bottle try local golf course us mix margarita thought would good start didnt search long find actually paid decent price container easy pour sturdy use jose cuervo mix margarita although think tequila would work dont shake mine yet still need buy shaker give good mix overall taste mix sweet tart overly powerful sens recently mowed lawn cocktail mix right flavor enjoy nice summer day definitely purchasing mix near future maybe adding different fruit flavor punch notch dont get wrong flavor bottle good

"I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I don't drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldn't work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup.

"My lips are almost ALWAYS chapped without Carmex. I've had dry and chapped lips for so long and I've tried everything: Blistex, EOS, Chapsticks, Lucas' PawPaw and even medicated lip ointments. I recently picked up a Carmex over an 'instinctual urge' and I don't think I've ever looked back since. Carmex does wonders for my lips. They're so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick. I've found with Lucas' Pawpaw, it's only good for chapped lips and Blistex and EOS only gives me a thin layer of lip balm. I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesn't absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more. I recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy. I've only needed to apply it 3-4 times daily, and I have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me.

So we moved on to the Cabernet - and it was almost the same thing. I haven't tried the Merlot yet but not looking forward to it. If I had bought these at a local shop they would be returned.

The funny thing is, we aren't even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. I'm giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!!

The Moscato was indeed sweet (just like you'd expect from a Moscato), and the Syrah was not too bad. I guess I should have said from the outset that I'm a sweet-wine drinker (I like sweet red wines), so the Red was not to my liking because it was too dry. I never drink Chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me. But, Kevin O'Leary's Chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order! It is awesome, magnificent, and very tasty! I even ordered some Fettuccine just so I could pair it with the Chardonnay. Great find (for me). I'm so glad I ordered the auto-delivery because I can't wait to see what I get in the Spring.

In fact, even without glasses, this would've been a good value to ship across country. I was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and I was floored. It looks gorgeous. And expensive. I can't speak to the quality of the wine, but as far as the overall gift, I am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again. However, as another reviewer noted and that I did not read before purchasing, there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated let's get naked referring I'm sure to the name of the winery. And also I truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses, which is my fault, but I have to say I did not like that.
